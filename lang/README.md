[Business OS](https://selldone.com), The next evolution in commerce services will be a platform that allows users to
create and manage their online store without the need for coding or the use of themes and plugins. This platform will be
completely visually based, enabling users to create and customize their store simply by dragging and dropping elements
into place. This will make it easier for users to set up and manage their online store, allowing them to focus on
growing their business rather than worrying about technical details.
